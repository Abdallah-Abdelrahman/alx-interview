# Pascal's Triangle

Is an arrangement of binomial coefficients in triangular form. It is named after the French mathematician Blaise Pascal. The numbers in Pascal's triangle are placed in such a way that each number is the sum of two numbers just above the number. Pascals triangle is used widely in probability theory, combinatorics, and algebra.<br>
Generally, we can use Pascal's triangle to find the coefficients of binomial expansion, to find the probability of heads and tails in a toss, in combinations of certain things, etc.

## Pascals Triangle Explained

Pascals triangle or Pascal's triangle is a special triangle that is named after Blaise Pascal, in this triangle, we start with 1 at the top, then 1s at both sides of the triangle until the end. The middle numbers are so filled that each number is the sum of the two numbers just above it. The number of elements in the nth row is equal to (n + 1) elements. Pascal's triangle can be constructed by writing 1 as the first and the last element of a row and the other elements of the row are obtained from the sum of the two consecutive elements of the previous row. Pascal's triangle can be constructed easily by just adding the pair of successive numbers in the preceding lines and writing them in the new line.<br>

Pascals triangle or Pascal's triangle is shown in the image below. Here, we can see that any number is the sum of the two numbers just above that number.
