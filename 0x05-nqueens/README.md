# N Queens

a classic problem in computer science and mathematics, known for its application of the backtracking algorithm to place N non-attacking queens on an N×N chessboard.

## Concepts Needed:

1. Backtracking Algorithms:

    Understanding how backtracking algorithms work to explore all potential solutions to a problem and backtrack when a solution cannot be completed.

2. Recursion:

    Using recursive functions to implement backtracking algorithms.

3. List Manipulations in Python:

    Creating and manipulating lists, especially to store the positions of queens on the board.

4. Python Command Line Arguments:

    Handling command-line arguments with the sys module.
