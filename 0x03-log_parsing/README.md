# Log Parsing

focusing on parsing and processing data streams in real-time. This project involves reading from standard input (stdin), handling data in a specific format, and performing calculations based on the input data.

## Concepts Needed:

1. File I/O in Python:

Understand how to read from sys.stdin line by line.
Python Input and Output

2. Signal Handling in Python:

Handling keyboard interruption (CTRL + C) using signal handling in Python.
Python Signal Handling

3. Data Processing:

Parsing strings to extract specific data points.
Aggregating data to compute summaries.

4. Regular Expressions:

Using regular expressions to validate the format of each line.

5. Dictionaries in Python:

Using dictionaries to count occurrences of status codes and accumulate file sizes.

6. Exception Handling:

Handling possible exceptions that may arise during file reading and data processing.
