# UTF-8 Validation

understanding of the UTF-8 encoding scheme, and Python programming skills to validate whether a given dataset represents a valid UTF-8 encoding.

## Concepts Needed:

1. Bitwise Operations in Python:

    Understanding how to manipulate bits in Python, including operations like AND (&), OR (|), XOR (^), NOT (~), shifts (<<, >>).

2. UTF-8 Encoding Scheme:

    Familiarity with the UTF-8 encoding rules, including how characters are encoded into one or more bytes.
    Understanding the patterns that represent a valid UTF-8 encoded character.

3. Data Representation:

    How to represent and work with data at the byte level.
    Handling the least significant bits (LSB) of integers to simulate byte data.

4. List Manipulation in Python:

    Iterating through lists, accessing list elements, and understanding list comprehensions.

5. Boolean Logic:

    Applying logical operations to make decisions within the program.
